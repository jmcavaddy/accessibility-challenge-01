# Horiseon Accessibility Refactor

## Accessibility
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards:<br />
WHEN I view the source code<br />
THEN I find semantic HTML elements<br />
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements<br />
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning<br />
WHEN I view the image elements<br />
THEN I find accessible alt attributes<br />
WHEN I view the heading attributes<br />
THEN they fall in sequential order<br />
WHEN I view the title element<br />
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title<br />
